\# Week 4 Lab
## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use: 
- Ctrl-C (copy)
- Ctrl-V (paste)
- Ctrl-Z (undo)

Shortcuts I would like to start using: 
- Ctrl-A (select all)
- Win-D (show desktop)
- Ctrl-K (Inserts Markdown formatting for creating a link)
- Super-Hyper-Meta-F (I donâ€™t even have such keys, but it sounds impressive)
